### Huffman Coding Overview

Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their frequencies. Characters that occur more frequently are assigned shorter codes, while less frequent characters are assigned longer codes.

### Example: Huffman Coding in Action

Let’s use a small example to illustrate Huffman coding:

#### Example Text

Consider the following text:

```
"ABRACADABRA"
```

### Steps in Huffman Coding

1. **Calculate Character Frequencies**

   First, count the frequency of each character in the text:

   ```
   A: 5
   B: 2
   R: 2
   C: 1
   D: 1
   ```

2. **Build the Huffman Tree**

   **a. Create Leaf Nodes:**
   - Create a node for each character with its frequency:
     - `A: 5`
     - `B: 2`
     - `R: 2`
     - `C: 1`
     - `D: 1`

   **b. Build the Priority Queue:**
   - Insert all nodes into a priority queue (or min-heap) sorted by frequency.

   **c. Build the Tree:**
   - **Merge the Two Nodes with the Lowest Frequencies:**
     - Merge `C: 1` and `D: 1` to create a new node `CD: 2`.
   - **Priority Queue after Merging:**
     - `B: 2`
     - `R: 2`
     - `CD: 2`
     - `A: 5`
   - **Merge Next Two Nodes:**
     - Merge `B: 2` and `R: 2` to create a new node `BR: 4`.
   - **Priority Queue after Merging:**
     - `CD: 2`
     - `BR: 4`
     - `A: 5`
   - **Merge Remaining Nodes:**
     - Merge `CD: 2` and `BR: 4` to create a new node `CD-BR: 6`.
   - **Priority Queue after Merging:**
     - `CD-BR: 6`
     - `A: 5`
   - **Merge Final Nodes:**
     - Merge `CD-BR: 6` and `A: 5` to create the root node `A-CD-BR: 11`.

   **Huffman Tree Structure:**
   ```
         [A-CD-BR: 11]
        /            \
    [A: 5]        [CD-BR: 6]
                 /       \
             [BR: 4]   [CD: 2]
             /    \
           [B: 2] [R: 2]
   ```

3. **Generate Huffman Codes**

   Traverse the Huffman tree to generate codes:
   - Going left adds a `0` and going right adds a `1`.
   - **Character Codes:**
     - `A: 0`
     - `B: 110`
     - `R: 111`
     - `C: 10`
     - `D: 11`

4. **Encode the Text**

   Use the generated codes to encode the original text:
   - Original Text: `ABRACADABRA`
   - Encoded Text:
     - `A: 0`
     - `B: 110`
     - `R: 111`
     - `C: 10`
     - `D: 11`
   - Resulting Encoded Binary String:
     - `0 110 111 10 0 11 0 110 0 111 0`

5. **Add Padding**

   If necessary, pad the encoded binary string to ensure its length is a multiple of 8 bits. For simplicity, let’s assume no padding is needed.

6. **Store the Encoding**

   Save the encoded binary data along with the Huffman tree structure (or the codes) so that it can be decoded later.

### Summary

- **Frequency Calculation**: Determine how often each character appears in the text.
- **Tree Building**: Create a Huffman tree based on character frequencies.
- **Code Generation**: Assign shorter codes to more frequent characters and longer codes to less frequent characters.
- **Encoding**: Convert the text into a binary string using the Huffman codes.
- **Padding and Storage**: Optionally pad the binary string and store it with the necessary metadata.

By following these steps, Huffman coding compresses data efficiently by reducing the average code length for more frequent characters, making it a powerful technique for data compression.


To estimate the amount of data required before and after compression using Huffman coding, let’s break it down with your example "ABRACADABRA."

### 1. Initial Data Size Calculation

**Original Text:**
"ABRACADABRA"

**Character Frequencies:**
- A: 5
- B: 2
- R: 2
- C: 1
- D: 1

**Character Frequencies and Assumed Initial Encoding:**
If each character is initially represented using standard ASCII encoding, each character takes up 8 bits (1 byte). 

For the given text of length 11 characters, the initial size is:
\[ \text{Initial Size} = 11 \text{ characters} \times 8 \text{ bits/character} = 88 \text{ bits} \]

### 2. Compressed Data Size Calculation

**Huffman Codes Generated:**
- A: 0 (1 bit)
- B: 110 (3 bits)
- R: 111 (3 bits)
- C: 10 (2 bits)
- D: 11 (2 bits)

**Encoded Text:**
The encoded text for "ABRACADABRA" using the Huffman codes:
- A: 0
- B: 110
- R: 111
- C: 10
- D: 11
- A: 0
- B: 110
- A: 0
- R: 111
- A: 0

**Binary String:**
0 110 111 10 0 11 0 110 0 111 0

**Concatenate the Binary String:**
0 (1 bit) + 110 (3 bits) + 111 (3 bits) + 10 (2 bits) + 0 (1 bit) + 11 (2 bits) + 0 (1 bit) + 110 (3 bits) + 0 (1 bit) + 111 (3 bits) + 0 (1 bit)  
= 1 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 22 bits

**Data Size After Compression:**
The compressed data size is 22 bits. 

### Summary

**Initial Size:** 88 bits  
**Compressed Size:** 22 bits

**Compression Ratio:**
\[ \text{Compression Ratio} = \frac{\text{Compressed Size}}{\text{Initial Size}} = \frac{22}{88} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]
This means the compressed data is 25% of the original size, or in other words, a 75% reduction.

Huffman coding has significantly reduced the data size in this example, showing how effective it can be for compression based on the frequency of characters in the text.
